Lot's of ideas have been buzzing around in my head, but I figured that I should make the framework a little more robust by adding a general architecture. At this moment in time there is a loose structure with #top, #left, #middle, #right, #footer elements. Yet the sidebars aren't styled at all. I figure a basic padding stylesheet will help better visualize for future projects. Anywho, my general idea is as follows (see image below). I also plan to have a stylesheet dedicated to default (as per wordpress standards) image alignment/disalignment styles. Also on the drawing board is an update to include reset.css &amp; and administration section for admins...
