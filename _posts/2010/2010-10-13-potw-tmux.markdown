It's another Tuesday (errm almost tuesday -- I got a little busy), and that means another PotW! This program is a little more useful than the last program. And makes living a mac more bearable (or any non tiling window manager for that matter) Tmux is the bees knees when it comes to console multi-tasking. It allows you to do a faux-tiling window manager with all your console apps, and the best part is that it's cross platform. Just a little info about tmux: It stands for terminal multiplexer (cool name for multiplier), tmux is like screen's pretty cousin, tmux is highly configurable, and a lot more stuff that I'll have to split up in a few more posts. (this is just a primer, and yes I will talk about tmux more ;)

**Program:** tmux

**Site Link:** [http://tmux.sourceforge.net](http://tmux.sourceforge.net)

**Download:**
  1. Download direct: [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tmux/tmux-1.3.tar.gz](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tmux/tmux-1.3.tar.gz)

  2. Use CVS & get the newest version: [CVS instructions for tmux](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmux/develop)


**Installation:**
  1. Use your package manager (pacman -S tmux for archlinux)
	
  2. Mac (download [homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) && **sudo brew install tmux**)


**Compile:**

{% highlight bash %}

./configure

make -j8 (make with 8 jobs at once [compile faster on a core duo])

sudo make install

{% endhighlight %}

**How to use:**

Lets start with the basics. Fire up tmux, and lets learn how to get some, errrm, **help!**
	
  1. **man tmux** (best resource, and well documented)
	
  2. ^b ? (Ctrl-?) \[Press Ctrl-b, then ?] (will show commands with short descriptions)


**Lets start with some basics:**

  * make a new vertical pane: ^b % (Carat **'^'** means Ctrl)
	
  * make a new horizontal pane: ^b "

	
  * make a new window: ^b c

	
  * rename window: ^b ,

	
  * move around: ^b (use arrow keys)


**Now that you know your way around, lets have some fun:**



	
  * Find test in an open window: ^b f (this one tickles me pink, it's so kewl that you can search for *anything*, and it will auto-move to the terminal your thinking of)

	
  * enter copy mode to copy text in buffer: ^b \[

	
  * paste the text you've copied: ^b \]

	
  * what time is it?: ^b t

	
  * swap panes around: ^b { (previous pane) and } (next pane)
