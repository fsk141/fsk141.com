I have happilly put my guitar back to good use. Along with my girlfriends Jasmine S35 by Takamine (I'll prolly purchase soon). Anywho since I cant lead astray from computers very long I've found some neat little programs to help me out. 

First off is [TuxGuitar](http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar). TuxGuitar is awesome, it has tabs, notes, and uses midi to give you a wonderful nintendo experience of your favorite songs. It also accepts Guitar Pro files which makes it invaluable in learning with tabs.

Second piece of goodness is [GNUitar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuitar). GNUitar is a simple effects processor. It was easy to install, and works wonderfully.

Along with that I'm currently learning:
