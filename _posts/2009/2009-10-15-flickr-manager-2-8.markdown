http://www.seoishard.com/seo-tool/flickr+manager+2.8 << this is a piece of crap...

At the end of my post I mentioned that I thought seo is hard's flickr manager fix was inserting links into my posts, well I was right. So I started tracking down the little "fixes" they did. I found them, and then went looking for other people with the problem. Well I found a post in the wordpress forums:

[http://wordpress.org/support/topic/281990](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/281990) (go down to fwaggle)

Then I went to his site: [http://www.fwaggle.org/blog/internet/update-wordpress-plugins-profit](http://www.fwaggle.org/blog/internet/update-wordpress-plugins-profit) and grabbed the clean version.
I'm going to try my SEO skills and try and knock seoishard people out of the top spot on google, so that people can get the clean version, and not their dirty piece of garbage.

Thanks to fwaggle for the uber clean/fixed version!
