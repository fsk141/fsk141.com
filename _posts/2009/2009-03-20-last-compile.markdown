I sure hope so... Here is the latest from my [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org) PKGBUILD for the OpenVZ 2.6.24 ovz008.1 kernel build. I found what I hope is the last bug, and am just waiting for it to finish (takes 21 minutes total on my 2.0 Ghz Core Duo).

I hope to release 2.6.18, 2.6.24 (WIP), 2.6.26 bulgakov.1/chekhov.1, and 2.6.27 aivazovsky.1 in the future. I'll let you know when it's finished.
