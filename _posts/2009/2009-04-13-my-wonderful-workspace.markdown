I just wanted to post the amazing workspace that I built for myself a year and a half back or so in my closet. I started out with two boards of hard pine that I picked up at Home Depot. I fit the large 1 1/4 inch chunk of wood into the closet itself held up by wood tracers around the edges. Then I added a couple keyboard rails, and a spacious keyboard tray. Now that I think back, I wish I would have done a build log :(. Anywho, I fitted everything a few times, then stained the wood, and finished it off with a clear-coat. I proceeded to cut a wire hole in each corner, and screw in a PSU to the bottom right (seen in some of the pictures above my awesome laser printer \[ML 2851 ND]). I added all the pictures on my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/68444690@N00/sets/72157616519709295/), so you can check out a few different angles... But here are my favorites:

I keep a lot of stuff on my desk. I took the large mousepad (I'll show you later in the thread) to take some pictures of the great wood. 

From left to right desktop: (left tweeter, tea cups, zarafina tea maker, tea, 22" Viewsonic mounted on the wall, Make Daisy MP3 player \[need to fix a contact], Surefire L7, center tweeter, knik-naks \[whittled knife I made], potassium nitrate \[smoke bombs :)],cd's, right tweeter)

From left to right keyboard tray: (Compaq 11800 \[amazing], Red and Black workbook, guitar tuner, metronome, nokia n810 \[atop an xtracpads hybrid])

From left to right underneath: (Black Box \[4TB ZFS NAS server (2.7TB usable, 1 parity disk)], mini asus \[videos, desktop, home server], power strip, clump of goodies \[large sub, laser printer, sub controller, WRT 350N, DSL modem])

This is what my desk normally looks like. If if doesn't look neat and clean like this, it's overtaken by stuff that I've been working on, and too lazy to put away...
