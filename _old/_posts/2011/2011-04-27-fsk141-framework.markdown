Just testing it out, might keep the site like this for a while. The idea of Fsk141 framework is to give site developers something very simple with NO EXISTING styling.

I know that if you're a smart developer like me you want to write everything yourself, and don't want to have to track down styling's of others just to make something look how you want.

Why would I make something so... blank? Well I wanted something that I could easily start with to build more themes (mind you this is no where near complete, there is a lot to add, and probably stuff to remove). I played with a few of the existing frameworks, and to be honest they seemed a tad bit bloated, or not well commented, or just not what I was looking for. So when you cant find something that suits your needs, build it yourself!
I hope to add html5 doctype / functions to the framework next. The framework needs a lot of ids &amp; classes added for ease of styling; I just added the basics for now.

Enjoy,

Fsk141
