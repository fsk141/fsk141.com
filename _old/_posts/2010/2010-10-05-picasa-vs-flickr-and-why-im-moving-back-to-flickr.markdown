Hands down Flicker takes the cake when it comes to ease of use, features, api integration, and overall awesomeness. I used flickr for quite some time, and changed over to picasa to see how things were on the other side.

To put it lightly it's been a big pain in the ass:

1) Wordpress integration:[](http://tgardner.net/wordpress-flickr-manager/)

	
**Flickr** - [Wordpress Flickr  Manager](http://tgardner.net/wordpress-flickr-manager/) - Spectacular (This has ease of use written all over it,  while also allowing for advanced configuration &amp; integration  options)

	
**Picasa - **[Shashin](http://www.toppa.com/shashin-wordpress-plugin/) -  Literal definition = poo (It's a pain to update albums (prolly google  api crapola), it's laggy, it doesn't play well with thumbnails, it's a  slight pain to configure... Must I go on?)

2) Overall summary of use:

	
 **Flickr** - Has an excellent webapp (much better than picasaweb), has some great user-developed applications, has an amazing api to develop programs yourself, and is all around user friendly, handles pictures &amp; video (++) VERY well.

	
**Picasa** - Has a halfway decent webapp focused around "lets make this ui so easy a caveman could use it" ;), Only one desktop app (Picasa), has really cool face recognition app (also kinda creepy), another creepy thing is how google's picasa updater runs in the background... And while picasa does photos pretty well, it sucks hard when it comes to video.


3) Reasons I'm switching back to flickr:
	
  1. I'm a a big-time script kiddie, and flickr is my best friend in this regard, whereas picasa leaves me in the dark.
	
  2. Picasa's wordpress integration is destructive to productivity, whereas flickr's (wordpress flickr manager) integration makes things so easy, and straightforward.
	
  3. Video quality for picasa is disappointing. I love flickr's video player and quality.


This is just a quick post to vent, but I hope it might help someone from resisting the urge to go to picasa since it's integrated with google/picasa &amp; just stick with the sure bet Flickr!
