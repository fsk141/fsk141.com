This is one of a few WIPP's I have (Work in Progress Projects) It's supposed to be a replacement to my previous NAS, and is mostly complete. I'm just missing the case... :( Anywho I have a whole write up in progress also, that will document what I got (hardware, software, experience). This is just a mini-teaser with some raw hardware goodness
