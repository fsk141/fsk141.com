**Summary:**

So you're a performance hog, and would love to have water cooling, but can't bring yourself to the hassle. Everyone knows that water cooling is the best of both worlds when it comes to performance & silent'ness. And on the other side there are in-efficient fans, that are loud, push dust all over the place, and nick you in your fingertips when you're tinkering. Noctua fans are an entirely different experience than the norm (minus the nicking your fingertips bit \[that's just your own fault for tinkering]) The NF-P14 FLX is an amazing blend of craftsmanship & performance that I would dare to say is one of the finest fans you can buy. Noctua specializes in mainly fans & heat sinks which speaks loudly on the quality of their product due to a niche market. They have a small range of products, and make them very well. In contrast with water cooling, I've always gone the straight and narrow route of air cooling, and love the money I save, and the performance I can get out of a good set of fans, in a proper configuration

**Design:**
Lets start with one of the most obscure, yet most important parts of this fan; the cabling, and how awesome it is. This first element shows the immense amount of detail that is put into one of this art pieces. First we see the common set of three wires (ground, hot, and speed), then; a splendid item that is rarely seen on fans. A device that prevents the cable from ripping out of the motor... I might be going a little overboard on just a little piece of plastic, but I've played with a lot of fans from a lot of different manufactures & for multiple applications, and little things like these make all the difference in a fan that lasts for a lifetime. Even if the fan is never moved from its installed location, proper routing in the case of the fan allows you to easily tuck wires every which way and tidy things up. To finish up the package the main of the wire is covered in expandable loom & capped at either end with heat shrink tubing.

The cable is about 15" long, and is capped off with a standard 3 pin molex connector.

One thing that is easily overlooked about the fan is even though it's a 140mm fan, you can mount it in a 120mm slot. The fan blade is 140mm standard, yet the outer mountpoints are 120mm sized. In fact I was a little dumbfounded when I went to mount the fan into a 140mm hole & couldn't because it was too small. I realize now that I need a mounting kit, that was not included in the review sample that I received:

The branding on Noctua fans are unmistakable. From the color, logo, and  sexy curves, everything is suave, and harnesses the Noctua look. The  outer body of the fan is an eggshell color, and seems very strong for  how light the entire fan is. The fan blade construction is fantastic, and the nine blade fan cuts through the air like a hot knife through butter. It might be hard to spot in the picture, but the notches are staggered. This isn't just for looks, but has an acoustic benefit to make the fan more quiet, and easier to blend into ambient noise. I would definitely read through Noctua's guide on fan blade design, it's quite exquisite: [http://noctua.at/main.php?show=nf_p14_blade_design&lng=en](http://noctua.at/main.php?show=nf_p14_blade_design&lng=en)

One sub-thought is how the motor is constructed. Most of the time you just have to guess that there is a decent motor assembly, and hope for the best. Well Noctua gives a little outline of the "Metal Reinforced SSO-Bearing Shell & Magnet" claim on the front of the fan. The shaft is reinforced on the center inside & outside of the shaft. There are also reinforcements on the outside of the shell where the magnets go for the coil. It's a brilliant idea when most motors use an all plastic design, and all it takes is a little misalignment to totally screw up your fan.

The back of the fan complements the front, and to be honest isn't anything special & what I would expect from the back of a fan :)

**Performance:**

This fan screams pure awesome, in a quiet whisper. The funny thing is that even though this fan is almost dead silent, there are two more ways to make it even quieter per your application. The L.N.A && U.L.N.A (Low Noise Adapter & Ultra Low Noise Adapter respectively) which underclock your fan. The stock RPM of the fan is 1200 RPM, and you can clock it down to 900 RPM with L.N.A & 750 RPM with U.L.N.A. The only complaint that I have to Noctua is how they deal with RPM step downs. I dislike that to step down the RPM you have to add in a separate little coupler that adds a resistor. It would be ideal to have a switch on the fan that just had a variable resistor in the casing that would allow you to modify the speed on the fly. This really isn't that big of a deal considering the Antec fans that have this feature (3 pole switch for high, medium, and low), and it's nice, but useless for some applications. Plus I'm the kinda tinkerer that want's to have the switch mounted somewhere flush & accessible ;)

The actual airflow that comes out of this fan feels surprisingly low, yet it pushes a lot of air. According to Noctua about 110.3 meters^3/h. I wish I had some way to test this, but racked my brain, and couldn't think of a way to measure the airflow correctly. All I know is that with the fan mounted in an Antec Sonata II it decreases the internal temperature of the case about 4 degrees celsius as opposed to the case without an exit fan.

**Summary:**
This fan absolutely rocks. I've used Noctua fans in many of my projects & PC builds, and have always been happy with the money I spent for them. Mind you Noctua fans aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for. When you buy a cheapo fan from China-R-US & end up noticing that it's fried or making funny noises 6 months later, you end up shooting yourself in the foot. The Noctua fans perform great, and last forever (even with a thick coating of dust ;) The extra goodies like loomed wire, and reinforced motors end up being worth it when you go to build a new computer, and decide that your Noctua fans are still in perfect working condition. Just move them to your next build, and save money. I've had a paid of 120mm/80mm Noctua fans I've had for about three years or more, and I keep moving them between builds when I put one PC out of commission & build out a new PC.
