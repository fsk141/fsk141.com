Since the kindle dropped so drastically in price I couldn't resist buying one for my wife & I. I love the little machine, and do a lot more with it than just read books. I've had it for a couple weeks now, and rooted it the first night. I just haven't documented it till today! Lucky for you this is one of the simplest processes ever, and only takes a few minutes. After you jailbreak the kindle it only takes a minute to root the kindle over usb. The process should be the same for Kindle 3,2, and 1.

Well lets begin by jailbreaking the kindle:
**1) Start by downloading the following zip** ([kindle-jailbreak-0.3.N.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/52078/kindle-jailbreak-0.3.N.zip)), and unzip it somewhere you can remember
**2) Locate the file associated with your kindle:**

{% highlight bash %}
<pre>"*_k2_install.bin" - K2 U.S.
"*_k2i_install.bin" - K2 International
"*_dx_install.bin" - Kindle DX U.S
"*_dxi_install.bin" - Kindle DX International
"*_dxg_install.bin" - Kindle DX Graphite
"*_k3g_install.bin" - Kindle 3 3G US
"*_install.bin" - Kindle 3 WiFi
"*_k3gb_install.bin" - Kindle 3 3G UK
{% endhighlight %}

**3) Upload to your Kindle**

**4) Unmount kindle & press the \[Home] button**

**5) Press \[Menu] > Settings > \[Menu] > Update your Kindle (It will fail, but this is okay)**

**6) You're finished! Now your kindle can accept the other hacks released by the mobiread forums! (I'll upload tutorials to the screensaver hack / usb network / and fonts hack)

Enjoy!
