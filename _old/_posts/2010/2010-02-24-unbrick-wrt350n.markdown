Wow, so last night I tried to flash an unsupported ddwrt image on my WRT350N & I bricked it :(. I would have been golden, except for some reason boot-wait wasn't working. I spent about 30 minutes looking what new router I should purchase, when I thought, ah there are no good routers out that will accept DD-WRT; I'll just unbrick my current router...

Well to start I had to figure out how to open the darn thing. I ended up ripping off the top & bottom plastic where some nice torx security screws greeted me... Well a few came out with some nice twists of my torx driver. Yet a couple actually had the center pin proper height. Easy way to get around this, is to find a small phillips screwdriver. I was able to easily unscrew them with a phillips.

After removing the screws I was now able to access the board; most importantly the serial header:

From Left to Right (Yellow = 3.3V; White = Tx; Red = Rx; Black = GND)

I used my handy dandy CA-42 Serial to USB adapter:

It also has colored wires, and I should have matched them up, but I  kinda just plugged some alligator clips in & plugged them into the  right wires for the CA-42. The CA-42 layout is like this (Black = GND ; White = Rx ; Green = Tx ; Red = +V)

After connecting everything up, you should be able to see "output" & be able to hit Ctrl-C to be dropped into CFE>

{% highlight bash %}

nvram set boot_wait=on

nvram commit

reboot

{% endhighlight %}

Now prepare to copy the image over. I had three windows open. A window with the serial output, a window pinging 192.168.1.1, and a window to execute my push command. I would also recommend that you set (IP Address = 192.168.1.10 ; Subnet = 255.255.255.0; Gateway = 192.168.1.1) Once you receive a ping after rebooting run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}

echo -e "nmode binarynrexmt 1ntimeout 60ntracenput dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic.binn" | tftp 192.168.1.1

{% endhighlight %}

where 'dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic.bin' is the image you would like to flash (it took me about 6 different images until this one worked \[ this is the web flash image on the wrt350n page])
After running the following you should get something that looks like this:


If everything went as planned, then you should end up with a working router :) Yay!

There are plenty of resources on the internets. I found this wonderful link: [http://dg.cascade.dyndns.org/wrt350n.html](http://dg.cascade.dyndns.org/wrt350n.html) which perfectly outlines EVERYTHING I needed to do. It was very helpful in this process.
