I went to SCaLE last weekend, and was very happy to talk to the people at the IPv6 booth. I also jacked one of their "getipv6.info" stickers cause it looked neato & unixy. A day later I stuck it on my laptop (along with some other nice linux/gnu/openvz buddies); and a day after that I started on my journey to IPv6.
I've been working through [IPv6 Essentials](http://www.amazon.com/IPv6-Essentials-Silvia-Hagen/dp/0596100582/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267172912&sr=8-1) in my free time, and actually implementing it at home! I started out by bricking my router (earlier post), followed by epic failure when trying to configure IPv6 on my router. I was rewarded with a little success before I had to call it quits late at night. I manually assigned my IPv6 address to my mac and everything worked wonderfully ([ipv6.google.com](http://ipv6.google.com) for example)

Well I was dis-satisfied, and spent the better part of my day at home (Thursday 25, 2010) getting it to work on my router. Now everything works & I can reboot my router & expect everything to come back when it's back up. I will post how I got everything working ASAP since the current IPv6 articles are dated & chock full of mis-information.
In the process of moving to IPv6 at home I needed to make my dyndns IPv6 compatible. Well dyndns isn't IPv6 compatible (for free anyways), so I decided to switch to FreeDNS. It provides AAAA record support (IPv6), and allowed me to pass onto the next level of the HE.net certification:

Yay! I'm an IPv6 Enthusiast...
After reading through IPv6 Essentials I can see the real plusses to IPv6, and can't wait to take advantage of all it's neat features.
