I've started up learning LISP once again. I'm going to start from the beginning of SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming) I've gotten the introduction knocked out. If you would like to follow along check out my notes [here](http://files.getdropbox.com/u/52078/Notes/Notes.html#%5B%5BChapter%201%3A%20Building%20abstractions%20with%20Procedures%5D%5D). ATM I'm using [DrScheme](http://www.plt-scheme.org), but am looking for a simpler way of going about things...

I've added more static links to my array. Over the past couple days I've been trying to get my computerspace organized, and in the process I've added a lot of content to my blog. I hope it wasn't all for nothing, and that at least someone reads it :)
