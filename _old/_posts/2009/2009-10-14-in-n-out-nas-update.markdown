So I'm ditching the Via board that I purchased for the In-N-Out NAS, and opting for a nice 64 bit board ([Intel DG41RQ](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121373)). This sucks since I have to dump another couple hundred into the new board/cpu/ram/psu. Eh... Anywho this is kinda cool, cause now I have an extra board that I think I'll use to mod a few speakers I have into a media center for when I go out to the desert. Well I'm going to go buy the new hardware, and hopefully whip the working system up within the next couple days.
