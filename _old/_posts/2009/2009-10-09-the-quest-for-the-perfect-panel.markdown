Pics to follow on the next post (this is a quickie).  I'm in search for a panel for my openbox desktop. I'm used to the dwm top bar, and wish I could have something simple like that, but haven't found anything yet. As of now I've tried all the popular panels (xfce4-panel, gnome-panel, tint2, pypanel, fspanel, bmpanel) and I've liked tint2 (what I'm using now), and xfce4-panel was alright. I think I might try bmpanel again. This is all foreign to me, since dwm has been my only WM for a long time. The only reason I'm moving to something else is because I have a tablet PC, and I need a little mouse support. Also it's a major bummer that [Cell Writer](http://risujin.org/cellwriter/) doesn't work with dwm. Meh...

^ tint2 panel ^

On a side note openbox sucks, well unless you configure it. And I've configured it a little, but I would like it to emulate dwm, with Ctrl-Alt-Shift (Move Windows), and a few other dwm specific things.

I'm using pytyle to get the whole tiling wm'ish feel, but it's not anything like the real thing. I really miss dwm, and am pissed that I bought this Lenovo X200 Tablet, and am having issues finding a good WM for it :(
