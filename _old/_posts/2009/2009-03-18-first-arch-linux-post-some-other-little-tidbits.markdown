Well, as you probably don't know (since I have yet to advertise on my *new* blog) I'm an avid Arch Linux User. I just love it to pieces. I use it on my personal servers & clients. I recently have been dumping some time into updating my packages: [Link to my AUR Packages](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&K=fsk141)

I recently acquired the rtorrent-svn / libtorrent-svn / xmlrpc-c-svn packages. I deleted the \*-wt packages and merged them with the standard -svn packages. Hooray!

I have also been working on the OpenVZ package (updating the hell out of it). I updated it using the theory behind this wiki link : [Kernel_Compilation_with_ABS](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_Compilation_with_ABS) I have compiled the darn thing about 10 times as of now, and atm I'm hoping that I'm on the last compile (crossing my fingers that it will work) :)

I have started using subversion a little more in depth, and have been trying out branches:

[git-wiki](http://atonie.org/2008/02/git-wiki)

I'll make sure to post my results...
