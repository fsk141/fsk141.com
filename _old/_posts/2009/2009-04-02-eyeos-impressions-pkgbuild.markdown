I've followed the cloud os craze for a while now. I've tried a couple different implementations, and really haven't come across anything worth while. Well besides that I decided to try out eyeOS again. The last time I tried it out, it was a little difficult to install (multiple steps), the documentation wasn't the greatist, and it was a dysfunctional OS solution. My recent exploration into eyeOS start with a trip to my local [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org) to see if there was a PKGBUILD for eyeOS? There was, yet it hadn't been updated in a long time, and it was abandoned. Well I jumped right on it and made a new [PKGBUILD](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=7330). I added a little instruction for install in the eyeos.install (called after pkg is installed). I proceeded to go to http://localhost/eyeos I was introduced to three fields: root password, repeat root password, and hostname. I entered the information and was greeted with a nifty login screen :)

I created a new account, logged in, and started to enjoy the new eyeOS (compared to the crap that I used a while ago)

I uploaded my [PKGBUILD](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=7330) files via the upload utility, and was giddy to be able to select multiple files to upload. I opened it in a text editor and messed around with it. I tried the web browser, rss reader, and a couple other things.

I'm working on getting eyeSync working on my mac, yet have had no luck as of yet...
