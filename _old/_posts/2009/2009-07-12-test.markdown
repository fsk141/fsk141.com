[The Outdoorist](http://www.theoutdoorist.com) was born a couple days ago. My friend Christian and I went camping to Black Mountain and talked about how we have enough outdoor gear to review for a while. So we thought of a name on the drive back, and we've started up the site... I'm working on a review for Black Diamond Orbit. I will post here when it's completed.

I plan on posting some pictures soon from my adventure. One thing I really wish I really had was a working GPS while I was hiking :(. I brought my car gps, and it started working once I got up really high. This is where I stopped (In the shade). I took a brake, noticed I ran out of water, and then marched right down the mountain. I didn't want to get stuck without water. Check out where I ended up here:
